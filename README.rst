Mass Gathering Detective System
==================================================

**Author:** Yicheng Qian, Huan Le, Hung Do, Kevin Kong
--------------------------------------------------------

The idea of this system is to detect if a mass gathering exists in a room. In the past, people wore masks. However, the number of new coronavirus cases continues to increase rapidly. We do not believe that large gatherings of people will remain inappropriate until the Coronavirus has completely disappeared. So we came up with the idea and tried to build it.

System with Multiple Subsystems
---------------------------------

The system consists of several important features to function correctly. The system will have a subsystem that detects the number of people in a room, a subsystem that calculates the size of a room, a method to make several subsystems communicate with each other(share data with each other). Those statistics that are generated by each subsystem are correlated to determine if the mass gathering exists.

* Humidity and Temperature may be too hard to measure and those measurements take time to change just a little, so it is hard to capture and might not be that useful.
* Another good idea is to use CO2 sensor to see if huge activity is held in a room and many people are participating. I do not know if this way is efficient or not.

Counting People in a Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our initial thought is to use two ultrasonic/IR sensors, one is outside the room, and another is inside the room. If the one outside the room finds the person first, then the person is entering the room. Otherwise, the person is exiting the room.


Calculating Size of a Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ultrasonic might not be able to detect distances over 8 meters.

We can use two modules or we can rotate just one to measure the size of a room.


Sharing Data through Multiple Subsystems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Choice 1: Multiple Arduinos/RPIs communicate with each other using nRF. We can use various types of communication modules like Bluetooth module, nRF24L01, etc. For our problem we can effectively use nRF. And we can set which one is parent and which all are children. A single unit can receive from 6 other modules and vice versa.

With the following two choices, we can possibly build Web App to monitor data.

Choice 2: ESP8266 WiFi module 

Choice 3: BLE Bluetooth module


Cost
---------------------------------
The cost of building this system is awaiting to be calculated.
